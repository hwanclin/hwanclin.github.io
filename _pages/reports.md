## Investigative Report

The report titled "**Can One Earn a PhD from LSE without a Thesis? The Bizarre Story of President Tsai**" documents an array of critical pieces of official evidence on former Taiwan President Ing-wen Tsai's doctoral-degree fraud. This report represnts my indenpent effort in 2019 to disclose the doctorate scandal with a view to upholding the values of academic integrity, rule of law, and moral justice for my home island, Formosa. The report is available in SSRN:

Unfortunately, both the London School of Economics (LSE) and the University of London have remained unwilling to tell the truth to the world. The former was the school that Ing-weng Tsai attended during 1980-1982 while the latter was the degree-awarding body at that time.
