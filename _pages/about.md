Welcome! I am a computational economist applying dynamic modeling to macroeconomies for a computable general-equilibrium analysis. My research interests meet at the intersection of technological innovation, growth, international trade and finance, and macroeconomic dynamics.  I have served as assistant professor, associate professor, and professor of economics & mathematical finance at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

I was born and grew up in Formosa, known as Taiwan today. After earning my BA from National Chung-Hsing University in Taipei, I had served as international economic specialist for four years at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a central cabinet department in Taiwan.  I then started my graduate study in the United States to earn my PhD in economics from the University of Illinois.  I began my academic career in the United States. Meanwhile, I had stayed concerned about Taiwan’s transition from authoritarian rule to a democracy and contributed my media articles from time to time on the island’s economic development.

My academic work has been published in the Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, Oxford Economic Papers, Journal of International Money and Finance, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, Computational Economics, Southern Economic Journal, Journal of Macroeconomics, among other outlets. My current projects are devoted to some socially optimal alternatives to patents.
