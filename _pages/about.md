Welcome! I am a computational economist. I apply computational modeling to dynamic macroeconomic systems and explore system dynamics numerically for policy analysis. My research interests often meet at the intersection of technological innovation, growth, international trade and finance, and macroeconomic dynamics. As a teacher and researcher, I had taught several graduate and undergraduate courses in my specialized fields as I worked through the academic positions of Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor of Economics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

The foremost implication of my long-term research is that the world needs to supersede patents (or medical patents, in particular) with a special class of amortizing securities coined "*Innovation-Backed Securities*" (IBS) that I have designed. Patents are almost suboptimal, but my proposed IBS can be a socially optimal alternative.

I was born and grew up in Formosa, known as Taiwan today. I earned my BA from National Chung-Hsing University and had since then served as an international economic analyst for four years at the Taiwanese central cabinet department called "Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)." Afterwards, I earned my PhD in economics from the University of Illinois and henceforth started my academic career in the United States. As an academic, I have been concerned about geopolitcal tensions over Taiwan's international status while also contributing my media articles from time to time on the islandâ€™s economic development.

My academic work has been published in the Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, Oxford Economic Papers, Journal of International Money and Finance, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, Computational Economics, Southern Economic Journal, and Journal of Macroeconomics, among other outlets. My current project is to design some socially optimal, yet workable, alternatives to the world's suboptimal patents.
