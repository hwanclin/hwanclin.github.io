Welcome! I am a computational economist applying dynamic modeling to macroeconomies for the general-equilibrium analysis of dynamics in transition to long-run steady state. My research interests meet at the intersection of technological innovation, growth, international trade and finance, and macroeconomic dynamics.  I enjoy solving continuous-time dynamical systems from the algorithmic perspective. As a teacher and researcher, I have worked through the positions of assistant professor, associate professor, and professor of economics & mathematical finance at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

I was born and grew up in Formosa, known as Taiwan today. After earning my BA from National Chung-Hsing University in Taipei, I had served as international economic specialist for four years at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a central cabinet department in Taiwan.  I then started my graduate study abroad to earn my PhD in economics from the University of Illinois and henceforth my academic career in the United States. Meanwhile, I had stayed concerned about Taiwan’s transition from authoritarian rule to a democracy and contributed my media articles from time to time on the home island’s economic development.

My academic work has been published in the Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, Oxford Economic Papers, Journal of International Money and Finance, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, Computational Economics, Southern Economic Journal, and Journal of Macroeconomics, among other outlets. My current project is focused on designing some socially optimal but workable alternatives to the world's suboptimal patents.
