More and more economics journals have started to require authors that they should submit accessible computing source code and data so that their published research results can be verified and replicated. I welcome this trend wholeheartedly as it accords with the purposes of scientifc rigor and research integrity.

## Source Code for Published Journal Articles

* Python source code for solving differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) in [Lin (2026)](https://doi.org/10.1093/oep/gpaf024) published in *Oxford Economic Papers* is available in each of the three repositories:
  - Github: [PythonProgram_DAEs](https://github.com/hwanclin/PythonProgram_DAEs)
  - Zenodo: [PythonProgram_DAEs](https://zenodo.org/records/15233608)
  - OEP: [Supplemental data](https://doi.org/10.1093/oep/gpaf024)

* Python code for using the idea of homotopy continuation to solve mixed-type functional differential equations (MFDEs) in [Lin (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10614-016-9633-9) published in *Computational Economics* is available in the following repositories:
  - Github: [Homotopy_MFDEs](https://github.com/hwanclin/Homotopy_MFDEs)
  - Zenodo: [Homotopy_MFDEs](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18673015)
