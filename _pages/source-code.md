More and more economics journals have started to require authors that they should submit accessible computing source code and data so that their published research results can be verified and replicated. I welcome this trend wholeheartedly as it accords with the purposes of scientifc rigor and research integrity.

** Source Code for Published Journal Articles

* Python source code for [Lin (2025)](https:doi.prg/10.1093/oep/gpaf024) published in Oxford Economic Papers (DOI: 10.1093/oep/gpaf024) is availle in each of the three different repositories:
  
    Github: [PythonProgram_DAEs](https://github.com/hwanclin/PythonProgram_DAEs)
    Zenodo: [PythonProgram_DAEs](https://zenodo.org/records/15233608)
    OEP: (forthoming soon)

The main purpose of the Python source code is to solve a eight-dimensional dynamical system of differential-algebraic equation (DAEs) numerically for the analysis of North-South protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs).
