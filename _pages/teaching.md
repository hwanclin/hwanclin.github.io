# My Teaching Philosophy

Teaching is a critical activity for enhancing a countryâ€™s education system and human capital. I believe that one of the core values of education is to contribute to the mobility of social stratification: Everyone should have the opportunity to succeed. I always view teaching and research as inseparable and mutually complementary: research keeps teaching updated, while teaching spreads ideas and feeds back to research. Their mutual growth must build on honesty and integrity.

# My Teaching Activities

I taught courses at the graduate and undergraduate levels on UNCC's main campus and center city campus.  Students who took the graduate-level courses I taught in rcent years came mainly from M.S. in economics, M.S. in mathematical finance, and PhD in finance. I also participated in UNCC's Project Mosaic to promote Python programming to graduate and undergraduate students. Other than classroom teaching, I participated in the establishment of the University's Master of Science in Mathematical Finance program, which made its debut in the fall 2003 semester. Today, this graduate program has grown into a prestigious one in the United States.
