### My Teaching Philosophy

Teaching is a critical activity for enhancing a countryâ€™s education system and human capital. I believe that one of the core values of education is to contribute to the mobility of social stratification: Everyone should have the opportunity to succeed. I always view teaching and research as inseparable and mutually complementary: research keeps teaching updated, while teaching spreads ideas and feeds back to research. Their mutual growth must build on honesty and integrity.
