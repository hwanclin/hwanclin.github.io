Here, I make a narrative of my intellectual contributions to the economics literature right after a short list of ongoing research projects given below: 

## Research in Progress

**<ins>Project 1</ins>: [The Socially Optimal Design of Amortizing Innovation-Backed Securities](https://github.com/hwanclin/hwanclin.github.io/blob/main/files/Project1.pdf)**




**<ins>Project 2</ins>: In search of the Globally Optimal Shape of Patents for the North and South**

In this project, I plan to extend the canonical North-South trade model that [Helpman (1993)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2951642) pioneered more than three decades ago mainly by allowing patents to carry a finite length, as in the real world. In so doing, the North-South dynamical system will be formed by a set of **mixed-typed functional differential equations** (**MFDEs**) rather than by a set of **ordinary differential equations** (**ODEs**). This extension indeed presents a computational challenge. I also introduce another extension by allowing technological innovation to display diminishing marginal productivity. With these two extensions, it becomes possible for the first time in the international economics literature to analyze the globally optimal patent shape facing the world’s developed and developing countries. In the project, I plan to accomplish the two main tasks:

* Robustness checks: I plan to verify whether the conclusions of [Helpman (1993)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2951642) can hold in the extensive North-South model? 

* First-best solution: I plan to compute the first-best solution for the world’s uniform patent system by optimizing a typical patent’s shape in the two dimensions: *patent length* vs. *patent breadth*.
