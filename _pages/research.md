I am a computational economist, applying computational modeling to dynamic macroeconomic systems for policy analysis. My research interests often meet at the intersection of technological innovation, growth, international trade and finance, and macroeconomic dynamics. What follows is a brief description of my research in progress and my previous research's contributions to the economics literature. 

## Research in Progress

**<ins>Project 1</ins>: The Socially Optimal Design of Amortizing Innovation-Backed Securities**

This project is aimed to provide a *tax-funded public reward system* as an alternative to the world's prevalent *patent-based commerical reward system*. The proposed public reward system is funded by a non-distortionary head tax. Under this system, any successful innovation is rewarded with a novel amortizing security called "Innovation-Backed Security" (IBS) and the innovator must agree to place the innovative know-how in the public domain. The government is the IBS underwriter who guarantees a time-varying payout to whoever holds the amortizing security. 

Note that such a security is tradeable in financial markets and its equilibrium market value is tied to the discounted present value of a stream of time-varying payouts, subject to the innovative product's time-vary market performance prior to the security's maturity date. The payout flow at  time *t* is calculated by the security's payout ratio times the innovative product's time-*t* aggregate market sales attributed to all perfectly-competitive producers who use the same innovative know-how. 

In this project, I will show how to design the amortizing security's **payout ratio** and **payout term** so that the tax-funded public reward system can achieve social optimality in a continuous-time dynamic general-equilibrium model, where ongoing innovation proceeds in tandem with creative destruction. 


**<ins>Project 2</ins>: In search of the Globally Optimal Shape of Patents for the North and South**

In this project, I plan to extend the canonical North-South trade model that [Helpman (1993)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2951642) pioneered more than three decades ago mainly by allowing patents to carry a finite length, as in the real world. In so doing, the North-South dynamical system will be formed by a set of **mixed-typed functional differential equations** (**MFDEs**) rather than by a set of **ordinary differential equations** (**ODEs**). This extension indeed presents a computational challenge. I also introduce another extension by allowing technological innovation to display diminishing marginal productivity. With these two extensions, it becomes possible for the first time in the international economics literature to analyze the globally optimal patent shape facing the world’s developed and developing countries. In the project, I plan to accomplish the two main tasks:

* Robustness checks: I plan to verify whether the conclusions of [Helpman (1993)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2951642) can hold in the extensive North-South model? 

* First-best solution: I plan to compute the first-best solution for the world’s uniform patent system by optimizing a typical patent’s shape in the two dimensions: *patent length* vs. *patent breadth*.
